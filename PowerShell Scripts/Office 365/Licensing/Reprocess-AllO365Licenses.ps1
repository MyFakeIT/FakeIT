# Author: FakeIT (AI Assisted)
# Date: May 27, 2025
# Notes:
# - Useful for clearing licensing errors across the tenant after making changes to individual or group licenses.
# - Does not assign or remove licenses, only re-evaluates them for each user.
# - Requires Microsoft.Graph module and appropriate permissions.
# - Use cautiously in large environments â€” may take time to process all users.
